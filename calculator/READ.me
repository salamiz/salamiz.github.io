Creating a functional calculator app. Using event listeners on an external JavaScript file,
each button will be able to call a certain function to execute specific functional tasks.
JavaScript is used to click on buttons which affect an input field either by displaying numbers, arithmetic operators, clearing the field or evaluating the arithmetic expression in the input field. Inbuilt function "eval" is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions in the input field.
a "for" loop is used to loop through all the button elements in the html document to create a condition for the type of function to be called for buttons with unique text values.
